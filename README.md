*You can use <img> for the background, top right avatar and "Portraits" avatar, but NO image for the borders themselves.
*You can NOT use any SVGs or other PNGs for any other UI. Everything has to be just CSS.
*Keep in mind the little details, they are the important bits.
*The game is "StarCraft 2" and you can google for assets, including fonts for best results.
*You can use sass/less/css or anything that works for you.
*While the UI is super simple, we expect you to think in "components" and structure your code well.
*Bonus tip: Usage of mixins makes sense here.
*No responsive styles are needed.
